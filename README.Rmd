```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MvNormTest)
set.seed(1234)
x <- MASS::mvrnorm(1000, rep(0, 5), diag(5))
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
d3hCGF_plot(x); title("Using third derivatives of CGF")
d4hCGF_plot(x); title("Using fourth derivatives of CGF")
## basic example code
```
